# IMMO Analysis Methodology

## Core Philosophy

IMMO rejects marketing-driven analysis in favor of systematic, investor-focused evaluation.

**Principles:**
1. Never trust developer calculations as source of truth
2. Calculate independently from raw price list data
3. Use investor's actual tax rate, not brochure assumptions
4. Show both positive and negative cashflow phases
5. Stress test every recommendation

## Mandatory Rules

### Rule 0: Independent Calculation

**NEVER rely on developer calculation documents as source of truth.**

Developer "Berechnung" PDFs are MARKETING MATERIALS:
- Cherry-pick favorable assumptions (lower tax rates, optimistic appreciation)
- Showcase specific units that may NOT be the best value
- Use IRR figures that obscure real cashflow

**ALWAYS calculate independently from raw price list data.**

Use developer docs ONLY to verify:
- Financing terms (interest rate, Tilgung)
- Construction timeline
- Management costs

**What matters (in order):**
1. Gross yield (annual rent ÷ total price) - HIGHER is better
2. Price per m² - LOWER is better
3. Parking included - adds €20-25k real value
4. Size (50-75m² optimal for 2-bed rentals)
5. Floor (mid-floors or top preferred over ground)
6. Total price (lower = less capital locked up)

### Rule 1: Erbpacht First

**ALWAYS verify Erbpacht (ground lease) status FIRST.**

Check sequence:
1. Search documents for "Erbpacht", "Erbbaurecht", "Erbbauzins"
2. Check land share in price lists (< 15% = suspect)
3. Web search for development + Erbpacht
4. If suspected: verify before proceeding

**Action:**
- If Erbpacht confirmed with undisclosed costs → EXCLUDE
- If Erbpacht with disclosed, reasonable costs → Calculate impact
- If no Erbpacht evidence → Proceed

### Rule 2: Correct Tax Rate

**Use investor's ACTUAL marginal tax rate.**

For €200k+ income (Germany):
- Base rate: 42%
- Plus Soli: 42% × 5.5% = 2.31%
- Total: **44.31%** (without church tax)

Developer brochures often use 30-35% - this UNDERSTATES benefits for high earners.

### Rule 3: Two-Phase Cashflow

**ALWAYS show cashflow for BOTH periods:**

**Years 1-4 (with Sonder-AfA):**
- Higher deductions (5% special + 2% regular)
- Usually positive after-tax cashflow
- This is the "good period"

**Years 5-10 (Regular AfA only):**
- Lower deductions (2% regular only)
- Usually negative after-tax cashflow
- This is the "bleeding period" - investor pays out of pocket

**Never present only Year 1 numbers.**

### Rule 4: All Costs Included

**Include ALL costs in analysis:**

**Upfront:**
- Nebenkosten (transfer tax + notary + registry)
- Kitchen if not included (typically €5-15k)
- Parking if purchased separately (~€25k)

**Construction Phase:**
- Interest on drawn funds (no rent received yet)
- Formula: Price × 50% average draw × Rate × Months ÷ 12

**Operating:**
- Verwaltung (management): ~€1/m²/month
- Rücklage (reserve): ~€0.60/m²/month
- Interest portion of mortgage

### Rule 5: Conservative Assumptions

**Use conservative defaults unless data supports otherwise:**

| Assumption | Conservative Value | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Appreciation | 2%/year | Not 3-4% from brochures |
| Rent increase | 0% | Not speculative increases |
| Vacancy | 0% | Already conservative |
| Construction period | 18 months | Add buffer if uncertain |
| Average loan draw | 50% | During construction |
| Sale costs | 7% | Broker + notary + fees |

### Rule 6: Stress Testing

**For EVERY shortlisted property, calculate:**

1. **0% Appreciation Scenario**
   - What's the outcome if property value stays flat?
   - Usually shows loss - highlight this risk

2. **Rate Hike at Refinancing**
   - If rates are 5% at year 10 instead of current
   - Impact on monthly payment if not selling

3. **Extended Vacancy**
   - 2 months vacancy per year
   - Impact on annual cashflow

### Rule 7: Quality Assessment

**Numbers are not everything.**

Red flags to watch for:
- Cheap-looking materials in photos/videos
- Wooden ceilings instead of standard plaster
- Poor interior design quality
- Low-quality fixtures
- Unknown/unproven developer

**If investor reports quality concerns → EXCLUDE regardless of yield.**

Quality affects:
- Resale value
- Tenant quality
- Maintenance costs
- Rental speed

### Rule 8: Parking Research

**Research parking necessity for EACH location.**

Before recommending parking vs non-parking units:
1. Check public transport quality
2. Check development design concept
3. Assess city car dependency

**If excellent transport + car-free design:**
- Parking is VALUABLE but NOT ESSENTIAL
- Non-parking units can be recommended if yield better

**If poor transport or suburban:**
- Parking is ESSENTIAL
- Only recommend parking-included units

### Rule 9: Interest Rate Verification

**ALWAYS verify developer interest rate against current market.**

Before finalizing analysis:
1. Web search: "Baufinanzierung Zinsen aktuell [year]"
2. Check Dr. Klein, Baufi24, Interhyp
3. Compare developer rate vs market top rate

**If developer rate is above market:**
- Flag clearly in analysis
- Calculate savings with better rate
- Recommend investor negotiate

High-income investors should target TOP rates.

### Rule 10: Shortlist Presentation

**When investor is deciding between options:**

1. Present side-by-side comparison table with ALL metrics
2. Include clear "Choose X if..." decision framework
3. Show explicit trade-offs
4. Do NOT make final recommendation unless asked
5. Let investor decide based on their priorities

## Ranking Criteria (Strict Order)

1. **Gross yield** - PRIMARY metric (annual rent ÷ total price)
2. **Parking included** - Adds €20-25k real value
3. **Price per m²** - Lower is better value
4. **After-tax cashflow Y1-4** - Must be positive or near-zero
5. **Total upfront cash** - Lower = more accessible
6. **Size** - 50-75m² optimal for rentability
7. **Floor** - 2nd-4th preferred over ground
8. **After-tax cashflow Y5-10** - Lower bleeding is better

## Exclusion Criteria

**EXCLUDE from recommendations if:**

1. **Erbpacht with undisclosed costs**
   - Ground rent not provided in documents
   - Flag: "Excluded: Erbpacht - hidden costs"

2. **Poor construction quality**
   - Investor reports concerns
   - Flag: "Excluded: Construction quality concerns"

3. **Missing price list data**
   - Cannot calculate independently
   - Flag: "Excluded: Cannot verify pricing"

4. **Poor value metrics (all three):**
   - Highest price per m² (+20% above average)
   - Lowest gross yield (-0.2% below average)
   - Highest total price in portfolio

5. **Location premium not justified**
   - Premium price without proportional returns
   - Flag: "Excluded: Location premium exceeds value"

## Output Requirements

### Per-Property Analysis

1. **Key Facts** - Location, size, price, Erbpacht status
2. **Cash Required** - Upfront + construction phase
3. **Tax Benefits by Period** - Y1-4 and Y5-10 separately
4. **Cashflows** - Before-tax and after-tax
5. **Exit Outcome** - Year 10 value, costs, profit
6. **Final Metrics** - Net profit, ROE

## Advisor Report

When generating advisor briefing:

1. Use template from `templates/BRIEFING.md`
2. Include executive summary at top
3. Include priority questions for advisor
4. Show all calculations with formulas
5. Include stress test results
6. Translate if user specifies language
