<objective>

Run stress test scenarios on shortlisted properties:
1. Zero appreciation scenario (0% growth over 10 years)
2. Interest rate hike scenario (rates increase at refinancing)
3. Vacancy scenario (extended periods without rent)
4. Combined worst-case scenario

**Creates:** `.immo/analysis/STRESS-TEST.md`

**After this command:** Run `/immo:report` to include stress test results in advisor briefing.

</objective>

<process>

## Phase 1: Load Data

**Load config:**
Read `.immo/config.json` for:
- Investor profile
- Current assumptions (interest rate, appreciation)

**Load shortlists:**
Read all `.immo/analysis/*/SHORTLIST.md`

**Extract baseline projections for each shortlisted unit:**
- Total price
- Upfront costs
- Monthly cashflow Y1-4
- Monthly cashflow Y5-10
- Exit value (baseline)
- Profit (baseline)

## Phase 2: Scenario 1 - Zero Appreciation

**For each shortlisted unit, recalculate with 0% appreciation:**

```
Exit Value (0%) = Total Price (no growth)
Sale Costs = Exit Value × 7%
Remaining Loan = [same as baseline]
Net at Sale = Exit Value - Sale Costs - Remaining Loan

Total Cash Invested = [same as baseline]
Profit (0%) = Net at Sale - Total Cash Invested
ROE (0%) = Profit ÷ Total Cash Invested × 100
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Baseline Profit | 0% Profit | Difference | Still Profitable? |
|------|-----------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| [UNIT] | €[BASE] | €[ZERO] | -€[DIFF] | YES/NO |

## Phase 3: Scenario 2 - Interest Rate Hike

**Assumptions:**
- Current rate: X.XX% (from config)
- Hike scenario: +2% at year 10 refinancing
- Calculate new monthly payment after refinancing

**For each unit:**

```
Current Monthly Payment = Total Price × (Interest + Tilgung) ÷ 12
Remaining Loan at Y10 = Total Price × (1 - 10 years Tilgung)

New Rate = Current Rate + 2%
New Monthly Payment = Remaining Loan × (New Rate + Tilgung) ÷ 12
Payment Increase = New Payment - Current Payment

New Monthly Cashflow = Current Rent - New Payment - Expenses
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Current Payment | +2% Payment | Increase | New Cashflow |
|------|-----------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| [UNIT] | €[CURRENT] | €[NEW] | +€[DIFF] | €[CASHFLOW] |

## Phase 4: Scenario 3 - Extended Vacancy

**Assumptions:**
- Scenario: 3 months vacancy every 2 years
- Impact: Loss of 12.5% of annual rent

**For each unit:**

```
Annual Rent Loss = Monthly Rent × 1.5 (avg per year)
Impact on Y1-4 Cashflow = Rent Loss - (Rent Loss × Tax Rate)
Impact on Y5-10 Cashflow = Rent Loss - (Rent Loss × Tax Rate)

10-Year Vacancy Cost = Annual Rent Loss × 10
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Monthly Rent | Annual Loss | 10-Year Cost | Adjusted Profit |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| [UNIT] | €[RENT] | €[LOSS] | €[TOTAL] | €[PROFIT] |

## Phase 5: Scenario 4 - Combined Worst Case

**Combine all stress factors:**
- 0% appreciation
- +2% interest rate hike at refinancing
- Vacancy losses

**For each unit:**

```
Exit Value = Purchase Price (no appreciation)
Vacancy Cost = 10-Year Vacancy Loss
Higher Payments Y10+ = Payment Increase × remaining months

Worst Case Profit = 0% Profit - Vacancy Cost
```

**Output table:**

| Unit | Baseline | 0% Apprec | + Vacancy | Worst Case | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| [UNIT] | €[BASE] | €[ZERO] | €[VAC] | €[WORST] | [STATUS] |

**Status indicators:**
- PROFITABLE: Still makes money
- BREAK-EVEN: Within ±€2,000
- LOSS: Loses money but <€10,000
- SIGNIFICANT LOSS: Loses >€10,000

## Phase 6: Risk Assessment

**Generate risk summary for each unit:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 RISK ASSESSMENT: [UNIT]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Baseline Profit:    €[PROFIT]
Worst Case:         €[WORST]
Risk Buffer:        €[BUFFER]

Key Vulnerabilities:
• [Appreciation sensitivity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
• [Interest rate sensitivity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
• [Vacancy sensitivity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

Resilience Score: [1-10]

Assessment: [DESCRIPTION]
```

**Resilience scoring:**
- 10: Profitable in worst case
- 7-9: Break-even or small loss in worst case
- 4-6: Moderate loss in worst case
- 1-3: Significant loss in worst case

## Phase 7: Write STRESS-TEST.md

Create `.immo/analysis/STRESS-TEST.md`:

### If Risk Tolerance is MEDIUM:

### If Risk Tolerance is HIGH:
Choose: [UNIT] - [REASON]

## Mitigating Factors

Factors that reduce actual risk:

1. **Strong rental market:** [LOCATION] has [VACANCY_RATE]% vacancy
2. **Tax benefits:** Losses reduce tax burden
3. **Forced savings:** Tilgung builds equity regardless
4. **Inflation hedge:** Rents typically rise with inflation
5. **Liquidity buffer:** Investor has €[BUFFER] remaining after purchase
